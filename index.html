      <p>One of the most famous tales associated with Samrat Vikram Aditya is the story of his encounter with a demon called Betaal. The demon offered to answer any question asked by the king, but on the condition that he not interrupt the demon's reply. The king agreed and the demon told a series of tales, each ending with a riddle. The king solved all of the riddles, but when the demon revealed the answer to the final riddle, the king, unable to resist, interrupted the demon, causing him to disappear and leaving the king with a curse.</p>
